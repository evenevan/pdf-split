    <body>
        <p>Split a PDF by its outline into sub-PDF files. Proof of concept.</p>
        <a href="https://github.com/evenevan/pdf-split">https://github.com/evenevan/pdf-split</a>
        <p>Known issues: </p>
        <ul>
            <li
                >PDFs on PDF version 1.4 (and possibly below, untested) may not convert properly.
                You can (crudely?) upgrade versions by running the PDF through online tools and
                adding an annotation, removing a page, etc.</li
            >
            <li
                >If multiple sections share a page, that page will appear more than once in the output. This is a deliberate compromise; the alternative is mislabeled PDFs and nonuniform balance of sections.</li
            >
            <li>Sections in the outline with the same name will break.</li>
            <li>The outputs .zip file of some (all?) PDFs are reported as corrupt by Windows. I do not know why. Try 7-Zip to unzip if this is the case.</li>
            <li>Metadata and other information is not preserved from the original PDF.</li>
            <li>PDFs may become (a lot) bigger after being split. Like a 35 MB PDF might become 500 MB. Maybe. Sometimes.</li>
            <li>Various other edge cases and weird behavior.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This tool also prints page numbers to console (hit F12) if you intend to use a tool like Stirling-PDF.</p>
